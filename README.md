## REFramework_ClientHash for UiPath

This project is an implementation of the **Robotic Enterprise Framework** (REFramework) for UiPath, specifically designed for processing data in the form of client information and generating a hash code for each client. The REFramework_ClientHash automates the entire process of extracting data from a source, processing it, and storing the results in a desired format.
